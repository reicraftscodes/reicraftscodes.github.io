Hello! My name is May. I am an incoming Software Engineering graduate from [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). Way back from my second year, first semester, I got introduced to Spring Boot. Since then, my excitement and curiosity about building commercial applications using Spring Boot turned into a passion.

As of today, I am currently seeking a full-time Backend Engineer or Full Stack Software Engineer position, preferably React and Java.  I am also pursuing my goal of learning the cloud and being a Certified AWS Developer - Associate. Lastly, I am learning android development as well as UI/ UX design to broaden my creative skills!

If you are wondering what technologies and practices I have used, here is the list of technologies I have implemented primarily on my work experience, freelancing and personal projects!
