Hello! My name is May. I am an incoming Software Engineering graduate from [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). Way back from my second year, first semester, I got introduced to Spring Boot. Since then, my excitement and curiosity about building commercial web applications using Spring Boot turned into a passion.

As of today, I am currently seeking a full-time Junior Full Stack Software Engineer position, preferably Java and ReactJS.  I am also pursuing my goal of learning the cloud and being a Certified AWS Developer - Associate. 

If you are wondering what technologies and practices I have used, here is the list of technologies I have implemented primarily on my work experience, freelancing and personal projects!
