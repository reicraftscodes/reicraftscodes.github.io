A self-motivated, performance-driven, and a detail-oriented person with extensive knowledge of software designs,object-oriented concepts, development, and testing.

Currently, I'm an incoming graduate student from [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). On my freetime, I like to experiment different technologies, most primarily in backend infrastructures and cloud technologies. In addition to coding and learning new tech, I enjoy playing badminton, drinking coffee , and playing online games. If any of these things interest you too, I would love to chat!

<!-- On my freetime, I do a lot of personal projects where I experiment different technologies, most primarily in the field of Mobile Development, Cloud Technologies, and Backend Infrastructures.
I also often contribute and gave back to the open-source community by contributing and engaging in a community discussion, adding PR features, submitting issues, and peer code reviews. -->
